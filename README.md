# HA
Home Assistant Container for my setup

Due to https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-homeassistant/issues/116 every new container takes a long time to start the first time it launches.

This pre builts the container to my specific PUID/PGID - 8123

Daily builds based off the latest container from the folks at [linuxserver.io](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-homeassistant)

Feel free to fork for your own config needs
